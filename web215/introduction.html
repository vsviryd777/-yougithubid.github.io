        <li><strong>I'd also like to share:</strong> In Belarus, french fries are called ‚Äúpotato free.‚Äù It was funny to look at the expression on the face of the McDonald's cashier when we first tried to make order. After a few tries explaining what we wanted, we just pointed to the picture, but she definitely was confused.
