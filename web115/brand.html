    <p>“The cat has absolute emotional honesty: people, for one reason or another, can hide their feelings, but the cat cannot.” - Ernest Hemingway</p>
    <p>If you live in Charlotte and are a cat person or want to learn more about them, we have collected valuable and exciting information on our website. Join our club.</p>
    <p>My site is for those who love cats. The site will contain not only interesting information but also useful information for cat persons in our city of Charlotte.</p>
     <h2><b>UI/UX Design </b></h2>
    <p><b>Colors</b></p>
    <p>The main color I choose is light blue (this is a symbol of stability and reliability). I will also add a dark blue color for contrast.
     Text is black.</p>
    <p><b>Typography</b></p>  
    <p>For headings, I will use "Sacramento", in italics. (For beauty)
     For the main text part I will use the font family: 'Merriweather', serif. (For ease of reading)</p>
